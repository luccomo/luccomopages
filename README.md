Context Graph Manifesto  [https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01kdxa3wcx2sbh8zahtn1pkkqz](https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01kdxa3wcx2sbh8zahtn1pkkqz) The author discusses the concept of Context Graphs, which are triples-representations of data optimized for usage with AI, and how they relate to Knowledge Graphs and Graph Databases.


The author highlights the ambiguity surrounding the term "Knowledge Graph" and how it can refer to both a data model and a graph database, with Philip Rathle from Neo4j being a prominent promoter of the term.


The author explains that a knowledge graph is essentially a collection of triples, which represent relationships between data points, and that there are different ways to model these relationships, including using predicates and RDF (Resource Description Framework).


The choice of data storage (triplestore, property graph, or joined tables) depends on the use case, team expertise, and operational requirements, with TrustGraph using Apache Cassandra as its default graph store.


Large Language Models (LLMs) can work with both human-readable and machine-readable data, and can generate responses in various formats, making them a potential disruptor in information systems.


The use of structured formats like Cypher or RDF can improve LLM outputs, as the structure itself carries information, and decades of mature graph algorithms can be leveraged to establish relationships in data.
